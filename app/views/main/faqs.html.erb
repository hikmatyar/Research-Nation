        <b>What is Research Nation?</b>
        <p>Research Nation is a marketplace for finding, buying and selling market research</p>
        <b>How do you guarantee quality?</b>
        <p>Quality is very important to us and we ensure it in a couple of ways. First, we read and review every single file that is uploaded onto our site. If something doesn't meet our quality standards, it won't be allowed. Second, every publication comes with user reviews (powered through Facebook, so minimal spam), so you know what others think of the report. Thirdly, we ask authors to state their sources and methodology, and also allow them to provide samples and set their own sale terms and conditions. Through a combination of these methods, we aim to ensure that the publications on our site are of the highest quality and authentic.</p>
        <b>Is it legal?</b>
        <p>Yes, it is. We take steps to ensure that documents being submitted to us are original, and if they're not, they won't be allowed on our site.</p>
        <b>How do you make money?</b>
        <p>We make money by charging a commission on every document that is sold. This commission is 30% of sale price - so for example if you list a document for sale at US$100, and someone buys it, we'll keep US$30, and pass on US$70 to you.</p>
        <b>How do you protect my privacy?</b>
        <p>We realize this is a concern for you. Your data will always be your data, and you can delete your posts at any time. If you want to delete a post, you can do so through your dashboard (see link in the header - you need to login to see it). If you want to delete your account altogether, just email us at admin@researchnation.net, and we'll get it done and send you a confirmation. Finally, rest assured we will never share your information with anyone else.</p>
        <b>Is Research Nation a registered business?</b>
        <p>Yes, Research Nation LLC if the legal name of the company, and it is incorporated in the State of Delaware in the United States.</p>
        <h4>For Sellers</h4>
        <b>Can I list documents for free?</b>
        <p>Absolutely you can, and if you're a first-time publisher, you should actually do this. It's a good way to build your reputation before you start charging for your work.</p>
        <b>How do I find out when my document is sold?</b>
        <p>Every time your document is sold, you will receive an email from us. In addition, you can also view how many times your document has been sold, and your pending and paid earnings, through your profile dashboard (link in the header).</p> 
        <b>What kinds of documents can I sell?</b>
        <p>Pretty much anything you want to, really. Examples are: industry research, company research, polls, surveys, data sets and call transcripts. Try to be short and to-the-point and include statistics (and sources) back up your facts. File format has to be PDF, Word, Excel or PowerPoint.</p>
        <b>Can I publish academic articles, and anything else that's not business related?</b>
        <p>Yes! We want to build a diverse community around original intelligence, and would warmly welcome any non-business related intelligence that you want to share</p>
        <b>How do I delete or edit a document?</b>
        <p>Login to Research Nation, click on 'dashboard' in the header and navigate to the relevant section.</p>
        <b>How long will my document remain online for?</b>
        <p>We keep documents online indefinitely, but if you want to remove it, just let us know at admin@researchnation.net and we'll pull it off.</p>
        <b>Can I respond to a review?</b>
        <p>Yes, just post directly in the comments section below your post (on the seller page).</p>
        <b>What kinds of documents can I sell?</b>
        <p>PDF, Word, Excel or PowerPoint files.</p>
        <b>Can companies sell through Research Nation?</b>
        <p>Yes, they can. In the future we will also be giving companies the option to sell under the Research Nation brand, and/or create other offerings that are custom designed for the Research Nation community.</p>
        <b>When and how do I get paid?</b>
        <p>We process payouts every 45 days, and you can get paid either via PayPal or, if you are US-based, then by cheque. Please let us know your preferences by filling out the payout preferences form in your profile dashboard. You can update your preferences at any time. Once we have processed your payment, you will receive an email, and the status of that payment will also change from 'pending' to 'paid.' Please wait for a minimum of 7 working days before contacting us - it can take a while for payments to be processed. Also please keep in mind that the cheque you receive will be net of our fees.</p>
        <h4>For Buyers</h4>
        <b>How does payment work?</b>
        <p>You can pay for your purchases via credit card; we accept all major international credit cards, and use PayPal's Merchant Services for payment processing. Our website is SSL-secured (up to 128 bit), and also VeriSign certified. Should you ever have an issue with your payment, please let us know immediately.</p>
        <b>I can't find the intelligence that I'm looking for. What should I do?</b>
        <p>You can either contact people on our site directly (see 'profiles' view) or let us know and we'll find the right person for you. We’re also thinking of adding a ‘contest’ feature in the future – if you like this idea, reach out and let us know!</p>
        <b>How do I get a refund?</b>
        <p>You can email us directly or use the Contact Us page. In general, you need to have a compelling reason to request a refund. We can't guarantee we'll honor your request (it will depend on your reasons), but will certainly consider it and get back to you with a prompt answer.</p>
        <b>Problems with making or receiving a payment?</b>
        <p>Uh oh! Email us at admin@researchnation.net or use the Contact Us page to let us know</p>
