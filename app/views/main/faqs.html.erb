          <b>What is Research Nation?</b>
          <p>Research Nation is a marketplace for finding, buying and selling market research</p>
          <b>How do you guarantee quality?</b>
          <p>Quality is very important to us and we ensure it in a couple of ways. First, we read and review every single file that is uploaded onto our site. If something doesn't meet our quality standards, it won't be allowed. Second, every publication comes with user reviews (powered through Facebook, so minimal spam), so you know what others think of the report. Thirdly, we ask authors to state their sources and methodology, and also allow them to provide samples and set their own sale terms and conditions. Through a combination of these methods, we aim to ensure that the publications on our site are of the highest quality and authentic.</p>
          <b>Is it legal?</b>
          <p>Yes, it is. We take steps to ensure that documents being submitted to us are original, and if they're not, they won't be allowed on our site.</p>
          <b>How do you make money?</b>
          <p>We make money by charging a commission on every document that is sold. This commission is 30% of sale price - so if you list a document for sale at US$100, and someone buys it, we'll keep US$30, and pass on US$70 to you.</p>
          <b>How do you protect my privacy?</b>
          <p>We realize this is a concern for you. Your data will always be your data, and you can delete your posts at any time. If you want to delete a post, you can do so through your dashboard (see link in the header - you need to login to see it). If you want to delete your account altogether, just email us at admin@researchnation.net, and we'll get it done and send you a confirmation. Finally, rest assured we will never share your information with anyone else without your permission.</p>

          <b>How does payment work?</b>
          <p>You can pay for your purchases via credit card (we will be adding the option to pay through PayPal soon). Our website is fully secure, and we use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology and are VeriSign secured. Should you ever have an issue with your payment, please send us an e-mail at admin@researchnation.net, and we’ll be sure to get back t you within 24 hours, if not earlier than that.</p>
          <b>Can I list documents for free?</b>
          <p>Absolutely you can, and if you're a first-time publisher, you should actually do this. It's a good way to build your reputation before you start charging for your work.</p>
          <b>Can I sell document anonymously?</b>
          <p>Yes, but we would not recommend doing so - you're more likely to get traction when people can see your detailed information, than when they can't.</p>
          <b>What kinds of documents can I sell?</b>
          <p>Pretty much anything you want to, really. Examples are: industry research, company research, polls, surveys, data sets and call transcripts. Try to be short and to-the-point and include statistics (and sources) back up your facts. File format has to be PDF, Word, Excel or PowerPoint.</p>
          <b>Can I publish academic articles, and anything else that's not business related?</b>
          <p>Yes! We want to build a diverse community around original intelligence, and would warmly welcome any non-business related intelligence that you want to share</p>
          <b>How do I delete or edit a document?</b>
          <p>Login to Research Nation, click on 'dashboard' in the header and navigate to the relevant section.</p>
          <b>How long will my document remain online for?</b>
          <p>We keep documents online indefinitely, but if you want to remove it, just let us know at admin@researchnation.net and we'll pull it off.</p>
          <b>How much commission do you charge?</b>
          <p>Posting is free, and always will be. For every document that is purchased through our site, we get a 30% commission (which is deducted from the listing price)</p>
          <b>Can I respond to a review?</b>
          <p>es, just post directly in the comments section below your post (on the seller page).</p>
          <b>What kinds of documents can I sell?</b>
          <p>PDF, Word, Excel or PowerPoint files.</p>
          <b>Can companies sell through ResearchNation?</b>
          <p>Yes, they can. In the future we will also be giving companies the option to sell under the Research Nation brand, and/or create other offerings that are custom designed for the Research Nation community.</p>

        <p>You can either contact people on our site directly (see 'profiles' view) or let us know and we'll find the right person for you. We’re also thinking of adding a ‘contest’ feature in the future – if you like this idea, reach out and let us know! (admin@researchnation.net, or send us a message through the Feedback form).</p>
        <b>How do I get a refund?</b>
        <p>You can email us at admin@researchnation.net or use the Contact Us page. In general, you need to have a compelling reason to request a refund. We can't guarantee we'll honor your request (it will depend on your reasons), but will certainly consider it and get back to you with a prompt answer.</p>
        <b>Problems with making or receiving a payment?</b>
