        <p>These Terms of Service ("TOS") constitute a legal agreement between you ("you" or "user") and Research Nation, Inc. ("Research Nation"), the provider of the Service.</p>
        <p>As used in the TOS, the term "Service" refers to all of the various features, services and resources made available to you by Research Nation, including, but not limited to:</p>
        <p>Research Nation-owned web sites, such as www.ResearchNation.net and www.datamarketplace.com, as well as any other Research Nation-branded or co-branded web sites (including sub-domains, international versions, widgets, and mobile versions)</p>
        <p>Databases and datasets made available by Research Nation for you to download</p>
				<p>APIs and similar services made available by Research Nation for you to retrieve data from Research Nation or provide data to Research Nation</p>
				<p>Your use of the Service is expressly conditioned your agreement to, and your continued compliance with, the terms and conditions laid out in the TOS, so you should take the time to fully understand how it governs your relationship with Research Nation and your use the Service. Any questions, concerns </p>
				<p>or comments you have about the TOS may be directed to Research Nation at admin@ResearchNation.net.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      	<h3>Modifications</h3>
        <p>From time to time Research Nation may update or revise certain provisions of the TOS. Research Nation may amend the TOS at any time and for any purpose by posting an amended TOS on the Service. Any changes to the TOS will become effective immediately upon posting of the amended TOS unless Research Nation specifies another effective time. If you are a registered user at the time of such modifications, Research Nation will notify you of the proposed change via the Service. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the latest version of the TOS and any additional or modified terms and conditions that may be posted.

If you do not agree to any modification of the TOS, your only recourse is to stop using the Service. As a best practice, Research Nation recommends that all users visit this page regularly to monitor any changes.<p>
      </li>
      <li>
      	<h3>Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in separate written agreement with Research Nation, your relationship with Research Nation will always be governed, at a minimum, by the general terms and conditions set out at http://www.Research Nation.net/terms (the "General Terms"). To access or use some features, resources or other portions of the Service, you understand that you may be required to agree to and comply with additional terms and conditions ("Additional Terms") specifically applicable to such features, resources or other portions of the Service and such Additional Terms, as applicable, will be deemed to be incorporated as a part of the TOS.</p>
        <p>You understand that Additional Terms may be imposed by Research Nation or one or more of its third-party providers. Where Additional Terms apply to certain features, resources or other portions of the Service, such Additional Terms will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, such features, resources or other portions of the Service. In many cases, the Additional Terms applicable to a particular feature, resource or other portion of the Service will contain special permissions or restrictions that govern your use of that feature, resource or portion of the Service, so you should take the time to fully understand the Additional Terms and how they apply to your use of the Service.</p>
				<p>If there is any contradiction between the General Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms are given precedence, but only in relation to the specific features, resources or other portions of the Service to which such Additional Terms specifically apply. In some cases, a particular feature, resource or other portion Service may be available under one or more sets of Additional Terms. For example, a particular resource may be available for download at no charge so long as you agree to comply with certain restrictions specified in the Additional Terms applicable to the no-charge download while another version of the resource may be made available under less restrictive terms if you opt to receive it as a premium service and pay the fees specified in the Additional Terms applicable to the premium service. In general, if more than one set of Additional Terms potentially applies to a particular resource, the least
restrictive set of Additional Terms will govern your use of that particular resource so long as you comply with all of the applicable conditions and pay the applicable fees, if any, specified in that set of Additional Terms.</p>
				<p>In some cases, a particular feature, resource or other portion Service may have been obtained by Research Nation pursuant to a license or other legal terms established by one or more third-party sources that prohibit certain terms or conditions. In those cases, Research Nation hereby offers that feature, resource or other portion Service to you free of any terms or conditions that otherwise Would be incompatible with the applicable license or other legal terms, if any. Nevertheless, all compatible terms and conditions of theTOS are still binding on you and your use of that feature, resource or other portion Service.</p>

      	<h3>Protecting Children</h3>
        <p>The safety of children is very important to us. The Service is intended for general audiences in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If a child under age 13 attempts to register with Research Nation, Research Nation asks that they have a parent or guardian establish an account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. If a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by Research Nation, that parent can send an e-mail to Research Nation at admin@ResearchNation.net to request deletion of their child's account.</p>
        <p>Research Nation strives to create a truly safe place for children on the Internet. Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist parents in limiting access to content that may be harmful to minors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

If any part of the TOS is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of the TOS, all of which will remain in full force and effect. You agree that the TOS is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Research Nation.</p>
