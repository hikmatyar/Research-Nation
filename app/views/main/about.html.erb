          <p>Research Nation was founded in 2010, with the goal of becoming the world's premier marketplace for high quality, original business intelligence (focusing on emerging markets, to start with). We're on a mission to change the way intelligence is consumed and created in the marketplace today, and here's how we're going to do it:</p>
          <b>Empowering Individuals</b>
          <p>In the age of the individual, there's no reason why you should have to pay thousands of dollars for useless, recycled research, published by large companies who are far removed from ground intelligence. We believe that the best intelligence - best, as defined by authenticity, quality and ability to capture real market issues - comes from individuals who have actual industry experience and practical insights. Through Research Nation, we aim to empower individuals to share their data and insights, and in doing so, make money and build a brand for themselves online.</p>
          <b>Providing a Platform</b>
          <p>Every seller on our site has three unique tools. First is a profile dashboard, which he/she can use to track sales. Second is a seller page for every post, which is custom page that can be easily shared on social networks. Third is a profile page, which allows sellers to share biographical details about themselves, and also indicate their availability for a work engagement.</p>
          <b>Focusing on Quality</b>
          <p>Weâ€™re not going to be just another site where you can trade intelligence and data. Every post on Research Nation is backed by a user profile, an executive summary, sources and methodology, and, in some cases, a sample as well. We have a zero tolerance policy towards illegal or plagiarized content, and as such, will remove any such content immediately.</p>
