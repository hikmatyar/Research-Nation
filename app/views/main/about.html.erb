          <p>Research Nation is a website that you can use to find, buy and sell datasets, research reports and various other forms of business intelligence.</p>
		 <h4>The Problem We're Trying to Solve</h4>
		  <p><i>For Sellers:</i> Whether you're a startup, a company or a market research firm, the first question you want to know before preparing a research report, or dataset to sell is: are there any buyers? We help you answer that question by letting you post 'ideas' and engage directly in conversations (via our messaging system) with potential buyers.</p><br>
		  <p><i>For Buyers:</i> Isn't it strange that when you're buying a research report or dataset, you don't have any reviews or ratings to help you decide? For hotel reviews, there's TripAdvisor. For book reviews, there's Amazon. For research reports and dataset reviews, there's....nothing. This is the void that we hope to fill for you.</p>
        <h4>How To Use Research Nation</h4>
