          <p>Research Nation was founded in 2011, with the goal of becoming the world's premier marketplace for high quality, original insights. We're on a mission to change the way intelligence is consumed and created in the marketplace today, and here's how we're going to do it:</p>
          <b>Promoting Simplicity</b>
          <p>We want to make it simple, easy and quick to find what you're looking for. We do this through user-friendly filtering tools on the Browse Posts and Browse Profiles pages, and through tags.</p>
          <b>Providing a Platform</b>
          <p>Every user on our site has three unique tools. First is a profile dashboard, which he/she can use to track sales and purchases. Second is a unique, SEO-friendly page and URL for every post, which is custom page that can be easily shared on social networks. Third is a profile page, which allows users to share biographical details about themselves, and also indicate their availability for a work engagement.</p>
          <b>Focusing on Quality</b>
          <p>Weâ€™re not going to be just another site where you can trade intelligence and data. Every post on Research Nation is backed by a user profile, an executive summary, sources and methodology, and, in some cases, a sample as well. We have a zero tolerance policy towards illegal or plagiarized content, and as such, will remove any such content immediately.</p>
