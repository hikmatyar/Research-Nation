<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<span>Research Nation was founded in 2010 in London, with the goal of becoming the world's most open and collaborative marketplace for high quality, original market research. We're on a mission to fundamentally change the business intelligence is consumed in the marketplace today, and here's how we're going to do it:</span>

<h3>Empowering Individuals</h4>
<span>To publish, share and sell their intelligence in a secure, trusted environment. Knowledge sharing already happens in smaller groups - at places like McKinsey, where there is a McKinsey Research Institute where employees collaborate and publish their insights. We want to recreate this model - but in a forum and manner that benefits far more people.</span>

<h3>Providing a Platform</h3>
<span>To hundreds of freelancers and small firms that produce high quality research, but nowhere to sell. This platform can also help bring change to larger firms, by giving them a secure avenue for creating and selling new products such as singles/chapters only and white label offerings</span>

<h3>Focusing on Quality</h3> 
<span style="margin-bottom:30px;">And giving buyers the tools they need to assess quality before they spend their money. Reviews, sources, samples and easy comparison tools are all things we plan to use

We're on a movement to democratize the market research industry - and we need you to join us!</span>
