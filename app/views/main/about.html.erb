          <p>Research Nation provides user-generated reviews for market research reports.<br><br>The problem we aim to solve is quality assessment. With most products that one buys online nowadays, one reads reviews before buying. For example, when you buy books, you read Amazon reviews before buying. When you book a hotel room, you read TripAdvisor reviews before booking. With market research reports - for example, reports published by Datamonitor or Euromonitor - people spend on average a few thousand dollars per report, and yet there is no way to gauge quality, or no place to read reviews before buying.<br><br>We hope to fix this problem by allowing users to find, read and create reviews for any industry, company or country report. No other website currently does this.</p>
