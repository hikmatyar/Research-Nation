    	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>Users can access limited features of the Service without disclosing personal information. In order to access other portions or features of the Service, users must register for an account, which will provide the registrant with additional access to the Service. During the account registration process, ResearchNation will collect some personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: IP Address, user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number and any and all other information that you share with us.</p>
      <p>We receive and store any information you enter through the Service or give us in any other way. You should be aware that portions of the Service contain functions for collecting and tracking non-personally identifiable information about you including your IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, where you were referred from, and technical information such as browser type and operating system. If you have volunteered personal information, then ResearchNation may associate such information with information already tracked, as well as track additional personal information.<p>

    <li>
    	<h3>Why We Collect this Information</h3>
      <p>The information ResearchNation collects from you is used to respond to your request for products and services, for provision of such products and services, to determine your satisfaction with your purchase(s) and to customize our future interactions to meet your needs. The information about your computer and/or your mobile device is used to analyze marketing statistics, identify trends and continually improve the way in which ResearchNation] serves you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<h3>Contact Information, Storage and Sharing</h3>
      <p>Except as provided herein, ResearchNation will not sell or give any of the information ResearchNation collects through the Service or through any personal correspondence to a third-party entity. ResearchNation reserves the right to use that information, however, to market any additional services and products to you. ResearchNation sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters, providing customer service, and performing statistical analysis of our services. ResearchNation will only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and ResearchNation will prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose. You will always have the right to opt out of this type of communication by following the unsubscribe instructions included in any of the marketing emails ResearchNation sends you. ResearchNation may store and process in the United States or any other country in which ResearchNation, Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<h3>Use of User Information</h3>
      <p>ResearchNation reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of ResearchNation' activities, and analyze any and all user data (registration data, use history, etc.). ResearchNation intends to use personally-identifiable user data solely for internal purposes only, including without limitation for the purposes of responding to your requests for information and for contacting you. ResearchNation may use information about our users on an aggregated basis and will often share such data with unaffiliated third parties. An "unaffiliated" third party means one that (i) is not controlled by ResearchNation, (ii) does not control ResearchNation, and (iii) is not controlled by the same party controlling ResearchNation. For example, ResearchNation may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in marketing, to conduct audits, etc. After ResearchNation or any third party acting on our behalf discloses your personal information to an "unaffiliated" third party in such instances, ResearchNation can no longer control the use or further disclosure of your personal information. Consequently, ResearchNation and any third party acting on our behalf will not be responsible to you for such use or further disclosure.</p>

    	<h3>IP Address Use</h3>
      <p>When you log in to the Service ResearchNation will collect your browser type and IP address. ResearchNation may also store some information about your browser using "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. ResearchNation uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in; however, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies.

    <li>
    	<h3>Law and Law Enforcement Compliance</h3>
      <p>ResearchNation will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. This includes the disclosure, without notice, of any information ResearchNation has collected about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as ResearchNation, at its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ResearchNation or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<h3>Security</h3>
      <p>ResearchNation is very concerned and sensitive to the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. ResearchNation uses various security measures to both protect the Service and keep your information as safe as possible. ResearchNation secures the e-mail address you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while ResearchNation strives to protect your personal information, ResearchNation cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
      <p>Should a breach of security occur, ResearchNation will make any legally required disclosures of the breach as soon as possible, while still taking in to account any legitimate needs of law enforcement or measures necessary to restore the security and integrity of our system. Any notification of breach will occur in a private email correspondence with affected members or in a highly visible forum within the ResearchNation interface itself.</p>

    	<h3>Links to Other Websites; Email Referrals</h3>
      <p>From time to time, ResearchNation may include links to third party websites. This does not in any way speak as an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. ResearchNation strongly advises our users to be aware of and review any privacy or terms of use made available by these third party sites, as ResearchNation has no control over their ability to insert cookies or their collection/solicitation of your personally identifiable information. Any links that are found to link to sites that promote illegal or pornographic activity, however, will be removed. Until ResearchNation has an integrated system in place for the reporting of these links, users may send an email with their concerns about any link on our site to help@ResearchNation.com.</p>
      <p>If you choose to use any referral function to tell friends about the Service, you will be required to provide your name and email address and the email addresses of your friends. The form automatically sends your friends a one-time email inviting them to visit the Service. ResearchNation does not access or store this information, except to send the invitation to visit the Service. By using the referral form you are authorizing us to contact your friends on your behalf and to list your name and email address as the referring party.<p>

    	<h3>Forums & Other Interactive Services</h3>

Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please send an email to help@ResearchNation.com.
