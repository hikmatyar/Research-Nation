As a best practice, ResearchNation recommends that all users visit this page regularly to monitor any changes. Your use of the Service is governed by the Terms of Service ("TOS") available at http://www.ResearchNation.net/terms, and your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of this Privacy Policy, the TOS, and any future changes. By using the Service, you are agreeing to our collection and processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any future iterations. Any questions, concerns or comments you have about our use of your personally identifiable information or this policy may be directed to us at admin@ResearchNation.net.</p>
          <b>A Note About the Privacy of Children Under 13</b>
          <p>The Service is not directed to or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). ResearchNation does not knowingly collect or use any personal information of users of the Service who are under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
          <b>The Information We Collect</b> 
          <p>Users can access limited features of the Service without disclosing personal information. In order to access other portions or features of the Service, users must register for an account, which will provide the registrant with additional access to the Service. During the account registration process, ResearchNation will collect some personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: IP Address, user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number and any and all other information that you share with us.</p>
          <p>We receive and store any information you enter through the Service or give us in any other way. You should be aware that portions of the Service contain functions for collecting and tracking non-personally identifiable information about you including your IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, where you were referred from, and technical information such as browser type and operating system. If you have volunteered personal information, then ResearchNation may associate such information with information already tracked, as well as track additional personal information.<p>
          <b>Why We Collect this Information</b>
          <p>The information ResearchNation collects from you is used to respond to your request for products and services, for provision of such products and services, to determine your satisfaction with your purchase(s) and to customize our future interactions to meet your needs. The information about your computer and/or your mobile device is used to analyze marketing statistics, identify trends and continually improve the way in which ResearchNation] serves you.</p>
          <b>Contact Information, Storage and Sharing</b>
          <p>Except as provided herein, ResearchNation will not sell or give any of the information ResearchNation collects through the Service or through any personal correspondence to a third-party entity. ResearchNation reserves the right to use that information, however, to market any additional services and products to you. ResearchNation sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters, providing customer service, and performing statistical analysis of our services. ResearchNation will only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and ResearchNation will prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose. You will always have the right to opt out of this type of communication by following the unsubscribe instructions included in any of the marketing emails ResearchNation sends you. ResearchNation may store and process in the United States or any other country in which ResearchNation, Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
          <b>Use of User Information</b>
          <p>ResearchNation reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of ResearchNation' activities, and analyze any and all user data (registration data, use history, etc.). ResearchNation intends to use personally-identifiable user data solely for internal purposes only, including without limitation for the purposes of responding to your requests for information and for contacting you. ResearchNation may use information about our users on an aggregated basis and will often share such data with unaffiliated third parties. An "unaffiliated" third party means one that (i) is not controlled by ResearchNation, (ii) does not control ResearchNation, and (iii) is not controlled by the same party controlling ResearchNation. For example, ResearchNation may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in marketing, to conduct audits, etc. After ResearchNation or any third party acting on our behalf discloses your personal information to an "unaffiliated" third party in such instances, ResearchNation can no longer control the use or further disclosure of your personal information. Consequently, ResearchNation and any third party acting on our behalf will not be responsible to you for such use or further disclosure.</p>
          <b>IP Address Use</b>
          <p>When you log in to the Service ResearchNation will collect your browser type and IP address. ResearchNation may also store some information about your browser using "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. ResearchNation uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in; however, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to set your computer to accept cookies from the Service, you may also choose to be logged into the Service automatically. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Service or the other websites that you visit and you may experience technical problems receiving current information from such cookie-disabled websites or services.</p>
          <b>Law and Law Enforcement Compliance</b>
          <p>ResearchNation will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. This includes the disclosure, without notice, of any information ResearchNation has collected about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as ResearchNation, at its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ResearchNation or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
          <b>Security</b>
          <p>ResearchNation is very concerned and sensitive to the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. ResearchNation uses various security measures to both protect the Service and keep your information as safe as possible. ResearchNation secures the e-mail address you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while ResearchNation strives to protect your personal information, ResearchNation cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <p>Should a breach of security occur, ResearchNation will make any legally required disclosures of the breach as soon as possible, while still taking in to account any legitimate needs of law enforcement or measures necessary to restore the security and integrity of our system. Any notification of breach will occur in a private email correspondence with affected members or in a highly visible forum within the ResearchNation interface itself.</p>
          <b>Links to Other Websites; Email Referrals</b>
          <p>From time to time, ResearchNation may include links to third party websites. This does not in any way speak as an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. ResearchNation strongly advises our users to be aware of and review any privacy or terms of use made available by these third party sites, as ResearchNation has no control over their ability to insert cookies or their collection/solicitation of your personally identifiable information. Any links that are found to link to sites that promote illegal or pornographic activity, however, will be removed. Until ResearchNation has an integrated system in place for the reporting of these links, users may send an email with their concerns about any link on our site to help@ResearchNation.com.</p>
          <p>If you choose to use any referral function to tell friends about the Service, you will be required to provide your name and email address and the email addresses of your friends. The form automatically sends your friends a one-time email inviting them to visit the Service. ResearchNation does not access or store this information, except to send the invitation to visit the Service. By using the referral form you are authorizing us to contact your friends on your behalf and to list your name and email address as the referring party.<p>
          <b>Forums & Other Interactive Services</b>
          <p>The Service may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the Service ("Interactive Areas"). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. ResearchNation is not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor is ResearchNation responsible for how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please send an email to help@ResearchNation.com.

          <b>Non-U.S. Users</b>
          <p>The Service is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Service from a jurisdiction with privacy laws or regulations that differ from United 
States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and 
you consent to that transfer.</p>
          <b>Note to California Residents.</b>
          <p>The State of California enacted the Shine the Light law (CA Civil Code Sec 198.83) that permits customers of ResearchNation who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information during the past year for marketing purposes. To make such a request, send an email to help@ResearchNation.com.</p>
          <b>Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions</b>
          <p>By using the Service, you accept that your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and the TOS, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of Texas.

          <p>THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT DESCRIBES THE TERMS UNDER WHICH RESEARCH NATION, INC. OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO THE RESEARCH NATION SERVICE.</p>
          <p>BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY TERM OR CONDITION SET FORTH HEREIN, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
          <b>General</b>
          <p>These Terms of Service ("TOS") constitute a legal agreement between you ("you" or "user") and Research Nation, Inc. ("Research Nation"), the provider of the Service.</p>
          <p>As used in the TOS, the term "Service" refers to all of the various features, services and resources made available to you by Research Nation, including, but not limited to:</p>
          <p>Research Nation-owned web sites, such as www.ResearchNation.net and www.datamarketplace.com, as well as any other Research Nation-branded or co-branded web sites (including sub-domains, international versions, widgets, and mobile versions)</p>
          <p>Databases and datasets made available by Research Nation for you to download</p>
				  <p>APIs and similar services made available by Research Nation for you to retrieve data from Research Nation or provide data to Research Nation</p>
				  <p>Your use of the Service is expressly conditioned your agreement to, and your continued compliance with, the terms and conditions laid out in the TOS, so you should take the time to fully understand how it governs your relationship with Research Nation and your use the Service. Any questions, concerns </p>
				  <p>or comments you have about the TOS may be directed to Research Nation at admin@ResearchNation.net.</p>
				  <b>Modifications</b>
          <p>From time to time Research Nation may update or revise certain provisions of the TOS. Research Nation may amend the TOS at any time and for any purpose by posting an amended TOS on the Service. Any changes to the TOS will become effective immediately upon posting of the amended TOS unless Research Nation specifies another effective time. If you are a registered user at the time of such modifications, Research Nation will notify you of the proposed change via the Service. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the latest version of the TOS and any additional or modified terms and conditions that may be posted. Your continued use of the Service following any modification of the TOS constitutes your agreement to the amended TOS. If you do not agree to any modification of the TOS, your only recourse is to stop using the Service. As a best practice, Research Nation recommends that all users visit this page regularly to monitor any changes.<p>
          <b>Additional Terms</b>
          <p>Unless otherwise agreed in separate written agreement with Research Nation, your relationship with Research Nation will always be governed, at a minimum, by the general terms and conditions set out at http://www.Research Nation.net/terms (the "General Terms"). To access or use some features, resources or other portions of the Service, you understand that you may be required to agree to and comply with additional terms and conditions ("Additional Terms") specifically applicable to such features, resources or other portions of the Service and such Additional Terms, as applicable, will be deemed to be incorporated as a part of the TOS.</p>
          <p>You understand that Additional Terms may be imposed by Research Nation or one or more of its third-party providers. Where Additional Terms apply to certain features, resources or other portions of the Service, such Additional Terms will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, such features, resources or other portions of the Service. In many cases, the Additional Terms applicable to a particular feature, resource or other portion of the Service will contain special permissions or restrictions that govern your use of that feature, resource or portion of the Service, so you should take the time to fully understand the Additional Terms and how they apply to your use of the Service.</p>
			    <p>If there is any contradiction between the General Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms are given precedence, but only in relation to the specific features, resources or other portions of the Service to which such Additional Terms specifically apply. In some cases, a particular feature, resource or other portion Service may be available under one or more sets of Additional Terms. For example, a particular resource may be available for download at no charge so long as you agree to comply with certain restrictions specified in the Additional Terms applicable to the no-charge download while another version of the resource may be made available under less restrictive terms if you opt to receive it as a premium service and pay the fees specified in the Additional Terms applicable to the premium service. In general, if more than one set of Additional Terms potentially applies to a particular resource, the least
    restrictive set of Additional Terms will govern your use of that particular resource so long as you comply with all of the applicable conditions and pay the applicable fees, if any, specified in that set of Additional Terms.</p>
			    <p>In some cases, a particular feature, resource or other portion Service may have been obtained by Research Nation pursuant to a license or other legal terms established by one or more third-party sources that prohibit certain terms or conditions. In those cases, Research Nation hereby offers that feature, resource or other portion Service to you free of any terms or conditions that otherwise Would be incompatible with the applicable license or other legal terms, if any. Nevertheless, all compatible terms and conditions of theTOS are still binding on you and your use of that feature, resource or other portion Service.</p>
			    <b>Privacy</b>
          <p>Personally-identifiable information about you that Research Nation may collect during your use of the Service is subject to the Research Nation Privacy Policy. Research Nation encourages you to read and understand the Research Nation Privacy Policy which can be accessed at http://www.ResearchNation.net/privacy.</p>

          <b>Exclusions</b>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
          <b>Indemnification</b>
          <p>You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Research Nation and its employees, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, suppliers and agents (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties"), against any claim, suit, action or other proceeding against Research Nation Indemnified Parties, by a third party, to the extent that such claim, suit, action or other proceeding is based on or arises in connection with your use of the Service (or the use of any of your accounts or sub-accounts) specifically including, but not limited to, (i) any violation of the TOS; and (ii) any claim that any use of the Service by you infringes any third party intellectual property right, is libelous or defamatory, or otherwise results in injury or damage to anyone. You agree to pay any and all costs, damages and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs awarded against or otherwise incurred by or in connection with or arising from any such claim, suit, action or proceeding attributable to any such claim.</p>
          <b>Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue</b>
          <p>The TOS and any claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas and the federal laws of the United States of America without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service will be brought solely in Travis County, Texas, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
          <b>Termination</b>
          <p>You agree that Research Nation may, without prior notice, immediately terminate your access to the Service. Causes for termination may include, but are not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of the TOS, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by you (self-initiated termination), (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Service (or any part thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, and (f) extended periods of inactivity.

          <b>U.S Export Controls</b>
          <p>You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any content, data or software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination prohibited under such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government authorization.

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list. For avoidance of doubt, your assurances and commitments made pursuant to this paragraph survive any termination of the TOS.</p>
          <b>Protecting Children</b>
          <p>The safety of children is very important to us. The Service is intended for general audiences in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If a child under age 13 attempts to register with Research Nation, Research Nation asks that they have a parent or guardian establish an account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. If a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by Research Nation, that parent can send an e-mail to Research Nation at admin@ResearchNation.net to request deletion of their child's account.</p>
          <p>Research Nation strives to create a truly safe place for children on the Internet. Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist parents in limiting access to content that may be harmful to minors.</p>
          <b>Miscelalaneous</b>
          <p>Except as otherwise expressly provided in a separate written agreement with Research Nation that specifically states it takes precedence over the TOS, the TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Research Nation and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Research Nation relating to your use of the Service. If any part of the TOS is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of the TOS, all of which will remain in full force and effect. You agree that the TOS is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Research Nation.</p>
